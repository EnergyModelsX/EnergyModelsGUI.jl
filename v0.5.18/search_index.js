These can be found in src/descriptive_names.yml. These descriptions are extended/overwritten with EMX packages having a descriptive_names.yml file in a ext/EMGUIExt folder of its repository. That is, if you want to provide descriptive names for your EMX package, add a .yml file in this location, with the same structure as src/descriptive_names.yml.\n\nIt can be convenient to provide a user defined file in addition. If you have this file located at path_to_descriptive_names, simply add it using\n\ngui = GUI(case; path_to_descriptive_names=path_to_descriptive_names)\n\nIf you instead (or in addition) want to provide descriptive names through a Dict, this can be done as follows\n\ndescriptive_names_dict = Dict(\n    :structures => Dict( # Input parameter from the case Dict\n        :RefStatic => Dict(\n            :trans_cap => \"New description for `trans_cap`\",\n            :opex_fixed => \"New description for `opex_fixed`\",\n        ),\n        :RefDynamic => Dict(\n            :opex_var => \"New description for `opex_var`\",\n            :directions => \"New description for `directions`\",\n        ),\n    ),\n    :variables => Dict( # variables from the JuMP model\n        :stor_discharge_use => \"New description for `stor_discharge_use`\",\n        :trans_cap_rem => \"New description for `trans_cap_rem`\",\n    ),\n)\ngui = GUI(\n    case;\n    path_to_descriptive_names=path_to_descriptive_names,\n    descriptive_names_dict=descriptive_names_dict,\n)\n\nThe variables for total quantities (and their descriptions) can be customized in the same manner (see structure in the src/descriptive_names.yml file).\n\nIt is also possible to ignore certain JuMP variables. As an example, cap_use and flow_in (in addition to the variable con_em_tot which is ignored by default) can be ignored through:\n\ngui = GUI(\n    case;\n    model=m,\n    path_to_descriptive_names=path_to_descriptive_names,\n    descriptive_names_dict=Dict(:ignore => [\"con_em_tot\", \"cap_use\", \"flow_in\"]),\n)\n\nYou can similarly customize variables that indicate an investment has occured through the values of the key :investment_indicators in the keyword argument descriptive_names_dict. The default variables are which indicate investments are\n\ntextttcap_add for all nodes except for Storage,\ntextttstor_level_add for all  Storage nodes,\ntextttstor_charge__add for all  Storage nodes with charge capacity,\ntextttstor_discharge_add for all  Storage nodes with discharge capacity, and\ntexttttrans_cap_add for all transmission modes.","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/simple-example/#man-exampl","page":"Example","title":"Example with functionality overview","text":"For the content of the individual examples, see the examples directory in the project repository.","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/simple-example/#Running-the-GUI","page":"Example","title":"Running the GUI","text":"From the Julia REPL (i.e, command-line in julia; julia>), run\n\n# Starts the Julia REPL\nusing Pkg\nusing EnergyModelsGUI\n\n# Get the path of the examples directory\nexdir = joinpath(pkgdir(EnergyModelsGUI), \"examples\")\n\n# Include the code into the Julia REPL to run the following example\ninclude(joinpath(exdir, \"generate_examples.jl\"))\ninclude(joinpath(exdir, \"EMI_geography.jl\"))\n\nYou should then get the following GUI: (Image: Example image for GUI)","category":"section"},{"location":"manual/simple-example/#Functionality-overview","page":"Example","title":"Functionality overview","text":"note: Left visualization area\nThe left fraction of the window shows a visualization of the topology with the following functionality:You can move a Node/Area by holding down the left mouse button and dragging to the desired location (at which you then release the left mouse button). The Links/Transmissions to this Node/Area will be updated as well. All nodes associated with an area moves correspondingly when moving an Area object. The Area objects are indicated by double line edges as in the example below (each city is an Area). A selected Node/Area can also be moved using the arrow keys.\nSelecting a Node/Area/Link/Transmission (by left-clicking) will print information about this object in the box on the top right. The selected object will have a green line style.\nYou can select multiple nodes/areas by holding down ctrl and left-clicking.\nYou can change the focus area (pan) of the window by holding down the right mouse button and dragging.\nYou can zoom in and out by using the scroll wheel on the mouse.\nHovering over a component will show the name and its type (and investments if it has occured).\nA Transmission mode from the EnergyModelsGeography package will be dashed if it contains investment data (as can be seen in the example above from, i.e., Oslo to Bergen). A Node will have dashed edges if it contains investment data and the same for assosiated Links.\nThe legend box of Resources shows an overview of all resources in case[:Products].\nThe upper-left label indicates at which level of the topology you are at (top_level is an overview of all Areas).\n\nnote: Top left toolbar\nThe toolbar on top left of the window provides the following functionality:back: If currently in an area (opened by the open button, see below), navigate back to the Top level. This button has the keyboard shortcut MouseButton4 (or Esc). Note: This functionality only works when using the EnergyModelsGeography package, as in this example.\nopen: Open an area by first selecting the area to open and then clicking this button. This button has the keyboard shortcut space. Opening an area can also be accomplished by double clicking the area icon. Note: This functionality only works when using the EnergyModelsGeography package, as in this example.\nalign horz.: Align selected nodes/areas horizontally.\nalign vert.: Align selected nodes/areas vertically.\nsave: Save the coordinates of the Nodes/Areas to file (if there are multiple areas, a file for each area in addition to a file for the Top level). The location of these files can be assigned through the design_path input parameter to the GUI function (this feature has the shortcut ctrl+s).\nreset view: Reset the view to the optimal view based on the current system if the view has been altered (this feature has the shortcut ctrl+r).\nExpand all: Toggle this to show/hide all components of all Areas.\n\nnote: Top right text areas\nThe first text area (to the left) shows some tips of using the GUI by defult, but is temporarily changed upon a selection of an EMX object in which information of this object is shown. The second text area (to the right) shows result summary (if available).

It will automatically adjust when altering the different periods/scenarios. Note that the axis limits for the differnt plots are saved individually for each plot if altered (otherwise the axis limits updates automatically) but can be reset by hitting the reset view button (see below).You can zoom into the plots by scrolling with the mouse wheel.\nScrolling with the mouse wheel while holding in the x key will zoom in the x-direction and scrolling while holding the y key will zoom in the y-direction.\nHovering plots shows the nearest data coordinate.\n\nnote: Bottom right toolbar\nAn additional toolbar on the bottom right is related to the plot area above and has the following functionality:reset view: Reset the view to the optimal view if the view has been altered.\npin current data: Pin the latest plotted data, which enables comparing with other data in the same time type.\nremove selected data: After selecting a plot (left-click the line so it turns green), this button will remove it (the button has shortcut Delete).

The results from a JuMP model can be visualized through the keyword argument model for a given JuMP model m:\n\nGUI(case; model=m)\n\nIt is furthermore possible to visualize results from a saved model run. This however requires you to first save the results from a model run through the function save_results. You can then visualize the results from a saved model run, again with the keyword argument model.\n\nFor a given JuMP model m, this approach is given by\n\n# Specify the directory for saving the results and save the results\ndir_save = `path-to-results`\nsave_results(m; directory = dir_save)\n\n# Load the results from the saved directory\nGUI(case; model = dir_save)\n\nwarning: Requirements for loading from file\nYou must always provide a Case in EnergyModelsX corresponding to the model results when reading input data.
