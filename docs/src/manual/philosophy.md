# Philosophy

## General design philosophy

One key aim in the development of `EnergyModelsGUI` was to create a graphical user interface that

1. visualizes the topology and result from EnergyModelsX
2. draws inspiration from the [integrate](https://www.sintef.no/programvare/integrate/) framework for visualization of energy systems
3. has a simple architecture that minimizes dependencies on major packages
