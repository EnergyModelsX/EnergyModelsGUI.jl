EnergyModelsGUI enables an interactive framework for moving nodes in a topology which can be saved to file. Simply used the save button in the GUI after running the application (for example using one of the examples in the repository)
```julia
gui = EnergyModelsGUI.GUI(case; path);
```
where the variable path is where you want the save button to store your design.
